# SQL-Challenge

**This challenge included the use of data modeling, data engineering, as well as data analysis. 
**In order to answer each of the questions asked of the data in the query I used the information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files, and I specified data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints. Then after creating the tables I imported each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.
**Once the tables and data were imported I used various queries to analyze the data and create relevant ables for each of the corresponding questions.
